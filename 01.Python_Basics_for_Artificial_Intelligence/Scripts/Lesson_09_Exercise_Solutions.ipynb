    "In some scientific data there are so-called 'NoData Values', i.e. values that are used for measurements for which there was no measurement result. Such NoData Values are often found in raster data that is opened in geoinformation systems (e.g. outlines of oblique satellite images).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In geoinformation systems, the NoData values can be set (e.g. to 0 or -999) so that the raster dataset is displayed correctly.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In Python, changing the NoData values is a little more difficult.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The following list is intended to mimic a raster data set which has a size of 3x3 pixels. Each of the lists in the list should represent a series of pixel values of a gray value image.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In reality, raster data in Python is not displayed directly as lists (we will come to that later). For now, however, let's assume that this is the case.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. Create a function that can 'iterate' through the individual values and create a new list in which the previous NoData value 0 is set to -999. The structure of the list should be retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Use print statements when developing the function to get information about the individual elements of the loop. Think about how you can access nested elements."
